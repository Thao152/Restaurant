# Research Project: Restaurant Customers' Tipping Habits

This project explores restaurant customers' tipping behaviors, with a particular focus on differences between smokers and non-smokers. The analysis uses the classic tips.csv dataset and applies Python data analysis libraries to calculate measures of central tendency, generate descriptive statistics, and visualize distributions.

# Objectives

- Investigate tipping patterns across the entire dataset.

- Compare tipping behaviors between smokers and non-smokers.

- Visualize the distribution of tip values to identify potential differences in habits.

# Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x

- pandas

- matplotlib

# Workflow 
1. Load dataset (`tips.csv`)
2. Data cleaning & type conversion
3. Descriptive statistics
4. Central tendency analysis (smokers vs non-smokers)
5. Visualization (histograms, comparisons)
6. Conclusions
# Results

The overall distribution of tips is right-skewed, with most tips concentrated between 2–4 USD, while higher tips above 6 USD are rare outliers.

Smokers tend to leave smaller and less diverse tips, mostly around 2 USD, with very few cases exceeding 5 USD.

Non-smokers show a broader and more generous tipping behavior, with tips frequently ranging from 2–6 USD and several outliers reaching up to 8–9 USD.

This suggests that non-smokers are more likely to leave higher tips, while smokers are more consistent at lower amounts.
