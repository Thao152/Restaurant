# Research Project: Restaurant Customers' Tipping Habits

This project explores restaurant customers' tipping behaviors, with a particular focus on differences between smokers and non-smokers. The analysis uses the classic tips.csv dataset and applies Python data analysis libraries to calculate measures of central tendency, generate descriptive statistics, and visualize distributions.

# Objectives

- Investigate tipping patterns across the entire dataset.

- Compare tipping behaviors between smokers and non-smokers.

- Visualize the distribution of tip values to identify potential differences in habits.

# Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x

- pandas

- matplotlib
